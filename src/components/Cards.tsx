        "This method is used for automatically labeling data points in a dataset, using a technique called 'self-supervised learning'. The technique is based on the idea that if a machine learning algorithm can learn to label data points on its own, then it can be used to label new data points that are not in the training set. This would be useful for tasks such as image classification, where it is often difficult to obtain labels for all of the data points.",

The VGG16 model was able to classify the traffic light images with an accuracy of above 99% for the LISA dataset and an accuracy of above 94% for the MIT dataset. The ResNet152 model was able to classify the traffic light images with an accuracy of above 99% for the LISA dataset and an accuracy of above 98% for the MIT dataset.",
